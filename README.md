Welcome to My Introduction!

My name is LMBellinger & I am attending Houston Community College. I am a Summa Cum Laude of a Bachelor of Science in Psychology seeking to bone up on Maths & Computer Science skills. I have begun the first step in a long term plan to pursue a Masters of Science in Data Analysis followed by a PhD. in Psychological Research.

I love to learn & share what I've learned, so dream of teaching & researching at a collegiate level, however believe my choices could lead almost anywhere. Thus, I find this path very worth while & exciting.

I understand the benefit of passion-focused effort, as I've experienced how hard work in an academic environment pays off & has opened up my world. I wish to share my unconventional path in hopes it will potentially inspire other struggling students who doubt whether or not schooling or specifically STEM, is for them.

My love for learning & science developed through an unsuspecting background in the Arts. The inventive, problem-solving nature involved in executing installation and mixed medias created a new love; a love of electronics technology, & my first real-life, empowered understanding of certain sciences, for example, through the application of the principles of physics in Sound Art.

As I matured, I identified within me a desire to use what I am capable of to help others. I decided to concentrate my critical analysis on human psychology, a surprisingly natural transition from trying to divine what is in the hearts & minds of both audiences & artists. Most surprising, however, is that I would fall in love with Behavioral Statistics.

Being a late in life student of Maths & Science can be quite intimidating & daunting. Yet I know now because of wonderful mentors & teachers in my history that I have the ability to learn & achieve, through hard work, dedication, & planning.

I am a living example of how "right-brained" women can blossom through academia to find their niche, no matter how late, in STEM.
